The Sunrise Confession
As the sun rises, I want you to wake up knowing that my first thought isn't coffee, isn't work, isn't anything elseâ€”just you. 
The way your smile lingers in my mind, the way your presence turns my ordinary days into magic. 
If love was a fire, I'd burn forever in the warmth of you.
