The Love That Burns
This isn't just love. 
This is something wilder, untamed. 
A flame that never fades, a desire that never cools. 
I don't just love you - I burn for you. And if you asked me to prove it, I'd spend a lifetime showing you, over and over again.

"You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known - and even that is an understatement." - F. Scott Fitzgerald
