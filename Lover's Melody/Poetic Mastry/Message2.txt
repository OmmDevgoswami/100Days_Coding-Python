Your Body is a Poem
Every curve of your body is a verse I want to memorize, every glance you give me is a line that keeps me breathless. 
When I look at you, I don't just see beautyâ€”I see poetry, passion, something that leaves my soul aching for more. 
And if loving you is an art, then, my love, I want to be a masterpiece of your making.
