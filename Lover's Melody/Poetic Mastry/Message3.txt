The Night I Couldn't Sleep
Last night, I tried to sleep, but every time I closed my eyes, I saw you.
The way you laugh, the way you bite your lip when you're deep in thought, the way your eyes hold entire galaxies I want to get lost in. 
Tell me, love, how am I supposed to rest when you are the dream I never want to wake up from?
 
"You are, and always have been, my dream." - Nicholas Sparks
