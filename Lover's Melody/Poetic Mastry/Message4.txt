The Midnight Craving
It's past midnight, and I should be sleepingâ€”but my body misses you in ways I can't even describe.
I miss the way your fingers trace over my skin, the way your lips feel like fire against mine. 
I swear, if I could, I'd be at your door right now, pressing you against the wall, letting my hands speak all the words my mouth can't.
