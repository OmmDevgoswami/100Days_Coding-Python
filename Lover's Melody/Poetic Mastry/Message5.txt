You're My Sweetest Sin
They say the best things in life are sinful, and if that's true, then loving you must be my greatest sin. 
Because I crave you in ways that aren't just innocent - I want to explore every inch of you, memorize the way you sigh when I touch you, feel the way your body responds to my love like it was made just for me.

"I am yours, don't give myself back to me." - Rumi
