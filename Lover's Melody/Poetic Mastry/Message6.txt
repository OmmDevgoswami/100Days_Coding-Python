The Lips I Can't Forget
If there's one thing that haunts me, it's the taste of your lips. 
Sweet, intoxicating, addictive. One kiss wasn't enough. 
Ten wouldn't be either. 
If you let me, I'd spend an eternity pressing my lips to yours, mapping out every single way to make you melt under my touch.

"You are sunlight through a window, which I stand in, warmed. My darling." - Jessie Burton
