The Way You Ruin Me
You've ruined me, you know that? No other touch feels the same, no other presence feels as electric.
It's like my body only knows yours now, like my soul has memorized the way it feels to be wrapped up in you.
And honestly? I don't want to be saved. 
I want to drown in this, in us.

"You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you." - Jane Austen
