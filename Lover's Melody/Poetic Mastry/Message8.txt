A Love That Feels Like Sin and Salvation
Loving you feels like both sin and salvation. 
You set my soul on fire, yet you’re the only thing that soothes me. 
It's in the way your fingers trace over my skin like a silent promise, the way your voice alone can undo me. 
If this is love, then I never want to escape it—I only want to drown deeper in you.
