The Hunger That Never Fades
It doesn't matter how many times I hold you, how many times my lips find yours - I always want more. 
You've become my sweetest addiction, my greatest temptation, my never-ending hunger. 
And I don't just want to love you - I want to consume you, to make sure every part of you knows exactly how deep my passion runs.

"You are my today and all of my tomorrows." - Leo Christopher
